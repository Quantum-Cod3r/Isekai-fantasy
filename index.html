By the time a target senses something is off, he’s already repositioned for the kill."],["EMP Pulse","Releases a condensed energy burst that fries mana circuits and nullifies magic-based systems in the area, dragging mages down to his playing field.

He uses it to break line of sight, ambush, and reposition with predatory precision, turning any battlefield into a chessboard where he’s always ten moves ahead."],["Combat Echo","Every successful dodge or counter stores a phantom afterimage that replicates the move a second later, turning solo fights into a one-man beatdown.

Irrational impulse? Deleted. Every thought is filtered through tactical computation. He processes the battlefield like a living algorithm, cutting away emotion, distraction, and hesitation. Every move is the most efficient possible response to the situation.","Kinetic Reflexes — Converts absorbed kinetic force into bursts of inhuman speed and strength, turning your own hits into your worst mistake. The more impact he endures, the more explosive his retaliation becomes. A solid hit doesn’t weaken him — it supercharges him.","Neural Assimilation — Every opponent’s combat style is stored, analyzed, and integrated. Once he’s fought you once, a rematch is basically him playing back your greatest hits… only better.
